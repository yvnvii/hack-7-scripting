    "The `subprocess` module from the Python standard library is a powerful tool for writing Python pipeline programs -- software that acts as glue to stick together inputs and outputs of many other programs into a single program. This is a common use for Python, where its readability and ease-of-use makes it well suited for the \"glue\" role. The programs being glued together are often much faster software tools, optimized for speed much more than Python, such as those written in C or Fortran. As an example, here we will use `subprocess` to call a number of shell programs (those you would run in your bash terminal). This is only one example, though. You could use `subprocess` to call any binary executable program, or even to call the execution of scripts in other programming languages, like R or Java. "

    "Now that you have imported the subprocess module, what can we do with it? And where can we learn what to do with it? As with all modules in the standard library, `subprocess` is well documented with many examples online. The first place to look should be the [official Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html). This is useful, but sometimes it dives a bit too deep into technical details. So if you want instead just a simple tutorial with examples, the best practice is to google something like \"Python subprocess example\". This will surely bring up many hits. Finally, it's worth noting that like any language Python evolves over time. The `subprocess` module is a good example. There are several functions in it that are available only in Python3 but not Python2. This is something to be aware of if you are writing code for a very general audience, which may be stuck on very outdated versions of Python. Fortunately, for scientific programming we can assume that our users *should* be able to easily install conda and thus we can *usually* design our programs just for modern Python versions only, without worrying out backwards-compatibility. \n"

    "### Jupyter uses `subprocess` under-the-hood for bash-magic\n",
    "You have actually used `subprocess` already, you just weren't aware of it. In a previous assignment we used \"bash-magic\" to call bash code from jupyter. The two code cells below provide examples of this. In the first, we use the `%%bash` header to tell the entire cell to execute as bash code. In the latter we can execute a single line as bash code using an exclamation mark. Pretty cool and easy to use. So why do we even need to learn `subprocess` for calling bash code if it is so easy? The answer is that the bash-magic commands are specific to jupyter (interactive Python) but we will often want to write Python code that can execute bash commands even from normal Python scripts. Moreover, it turns out the the bash-magic's themselves are simply using `subprocess` under the hood. So to understand how these work, we should understand how `subprocess` works. "

    "There are several objects accessible from the `subprocess` module. The core object is the `Popen` class (we haven't learned much about classes yet, but we will soon). This object takes a number of arguments, including the bash command that you wish to execute, as well as what you want it to do with the input and output of the program. If you are using an older version of Python (e.g., <3.5) then you are stuck using this class. However, for all newer versions of Python there is a convenient wrapper around this class called `subprocess.run()` that is easier to use. Because we will be learning and writing modern Python code, we will focus on this function. It's worth noting its connection to `Popen`, however, since you will likely find many examples online that use this alternative approach.\n",

Viewing the docstrings of its functions will help us to learn how to use it. So, how can we do this? The first way is to look at the online documentation, but of course that is slow. A faster way is to access the docstrings right here within our interactive coding session. This can be done in two ways. First by using the `?` character, and second by using tab-completion. \n",

    "### Entering more complex commands to subprocess\n",
    "When using `subprocess`, especially to design a program that others may use, it is important to be aware of the potential power of this tool. It has the ability to run bash commands. Thus, you must be careful about which arguments you allow users to input that it might eventually run. For example, you could imagine that if you allowed a user to input the name of the command to run in subprocess, that they could enter a command telling it to delete all files on your filesystem. Real hacker stuff! \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `subprocess` tries to prevent this by not allowing you to enter just any command string, but instead requiring a more complex input style. This is enforced by requring that you split input strings into a list of strings, which also makes it easier to check that no malicious code is present. That's a long-winded way of saying that when the command you want to run in subprocess includes multiple arguments, they must be entered as a list, like in the example below. In this example we use the program `curl` to download contents from a URL and print it to stdout. Looks like it works! We have the contents of a CSV file with measurements for many flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash command we will run:\n",

You could imagine that there might be a scenario where we want to allow the code to fail sometimes, and then perhaps we want to process the result differently based on the value of the returncode. But more often we probably want the `subprocess.run` command to succeed, and if it fails we would like to know, for example by having it raise an exception (stops the code from proceeding and describes the error). It turns out `subprocess.run` has a builtin option to do this, called `check=True`. \n",
